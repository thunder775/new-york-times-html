    <p class="news-text">Even as nations from Britain to India declare nationwide economic lockdowns, President Trump
        said he “would love
        to
        have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter,” less than three weeks away, a goal that top
        health
        professionals have called far too quick.

        “I think it’s possible, why not?” he said with a shrug.

        Participating in a town hall hosted by Fox News on Tuesday, he expressed outrage about having to “close the
        country”
        to curb the spread of the coronavirus and indicated that his guidelines on business shutdowns and social
        distancing
        would soon be lifted.

        “I gave it two weeks,” he said, adding, “We can socially distance ourselves and go to work.”

        But at a late afternoon news conference, he softened his tone, saying his priority is the health and safety of
        the
        American people.

        At the news conference, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
        Diseases, sought to refine Mr. Trump’s Easter timeline, saying it would not pertain to hot spots like New York.
        There could be “flexibility in different areas” based on data, he said.</p>

    <p class="news-text">As the outbreak picked up pace in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who had adopted a friendly
        tone toward Mr.
        Trump,
        came close on Tuesday to chastising the federal government, which he said had so far sent only 400 much-needed
        ventilators to New York City.

        “You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators,” Mr. Cuomo said. “What are we going to do with 400
        ventilators when we need 30,000 ventilators?”

        Mr. Trump swiftly lashed out at Mr. Cuomo: “I watch him on this show complaining,” Mr. Trump said, before
        criticizing Mr. Cuomo for earlier failing to buy ventilators at “a great price.”</p>
